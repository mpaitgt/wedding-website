# Wedding Website

### Created this website for our guests so that they can easily book hotels in our available blocks, check out the wedding party, find things to do in the city, and RSVP.

### This website was hard-coded with plain HTML and CSS, and later implemented Javascript for form submission and Moment.js.

### The RSVP feature is accomplished with a form submission straight to Google Sheets with no back-end at all. [Check out the Github repo that helped me along the way.](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server)
